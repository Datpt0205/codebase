# Ops hardening

A platform status review on 2026-09-22 found six gaps an enterprise buyer would
ask about. Đạt chose to close five of them before picking the first bounded
context. All five are done and on `main`. The full narrative is at
`git show 84e3f6a:.claude/PLAN.md`, sections "Ops hardening".

## What holds, and where it lives

- **One retention file.** `configs/policies/retention@1.4.0.yaml` feeds the
  memory, knowledge and audit sweeps on the worker's hourly lanes.
    - Audit keeps 1095 days: Commercial Law Art. 319's two-year limitation plus a
      review margin. Decree 13/2023 requires deletion once the purpose ends.
    - `legal_hold` is never swept, and a class this build does not know is kept.
- **Partition creation is one function**, `platform.ensure_time_partitions`
  (CLAUDE.md, Data model rules). A partition created later inherits neither
  RLS nor the audit revoke.
- **Offboarding discovers tables from the catalog** (`pg_policies`), not from a
  hand list.
    - `platform.audit_events` is exported but never purged.
    - The one FK chain is purged in hand-checked order.
    - Stale claims older than 30 minutes are reclaimed.
    - Feedback attachments live under the `feedback/{tenant_id}/` prefix.
- **Metrics:**
    - a Prometheus reader is always installed;
    - `dw-api` serves `/metrics` at the root;
    - `dw-worker` serves its own scrape port (9464);
    - six alert rules, each against a metric the code really emits.

## Open

- **Spend guard quotas are unset.** Every plan's `spend_usd_per_day` is `None`,
  so nothing is metered until Đạt gives dollar thresholds.
- **Offboarding export bundles in `dw-exports` are never deleted.** They hold a
  tenant's full data, PII included, and need a retention term from Đạt.
- **Superseded documents:** how many versions to keep is undecided. That is a
  different question from how long a deletion takes to become final.
- **The restore drill is same-cluster only.** A from-scratch DR drill (new
  host, roles provisioned from zero) has not been done.
- **Alert thresholds are starting points, not measurements:** outbox backlog
  500, reaper 20/hour, run failure rate 0.2/s, DB connections 80%.
- **The reaper alert cannot fire.** No bounded context registers a
  `ReapTarget`; this checkout ships none (checked 2026-09-29).
- **`dw_node_failure_total` is declared and emitted by nothing**
  (`dw_observability/metrics.py`), so no rule uses it.
- **No Grafana dashboards.**
- **Accepted CVEs.** About 39–44 HIGH/CRITICAL remain per image, mostly
  transitive Go stdlib/x code. Pins: `prometheus:v3.6.0` (a newer tag did not
  help), `postgres-exporter:v0.17.1`, `alertmanager:v0.28.1`. Re-scan on every
  bump.
- **`dw_knowledge` MinIO tests failed** with `SignatureDoesNotMatch` in 16
  integration tests. That was seen 2026-09-23 on the old stack and has not been
  re-checked on the `dw_codebase` stack.
