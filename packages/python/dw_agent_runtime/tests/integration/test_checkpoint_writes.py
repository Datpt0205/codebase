"""The SQL checkpointer must record writes the way the reference saver does.

`InMemorySaver` is upstream's own implementation and the semantics every other
saver is written against, so these are differential: drive both through the
call sequence LangGraph makes around an interrupt, and demand the same pending
writes back.

The sequence matters. A task that interrupts writes ``__interrupt__``; when the
approval arrives the SAME task re-runs against the SAME checkpoint and writes
its real output. Upstream keeps the two apart by reserving negative indices for
the special channels (``WRITES_IDX_MAP``), so the output write is free to take
index 0. A saver that enumerates blindly puts ``__interrupt__`` on index 0 and
then drops the output write as a duplicate - and what sits at index 0 of an
agent's output batch is ``messages``.

Measured in production before this was fixed: every turn that paused for
approval vanished from the assistant's memory the moment the next turn began.
It kept proposing the write it had already made, and a salesperson approving
each proposal ended up with three identical leads.
