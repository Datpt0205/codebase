"""The per-tenant daily run quota: the plan's number, enforced where runs begin.

The gate sits in the runner rather than in an API dependency on purpose, so
these tests drive it through `start` — a worker reacting to an inbound event
starts runs no HTTP request ever touched, and a quota only the API enforced
would be one a connector walks around.

The run itself is not the subject here. The fake store refuses to go further
than the claim, which is exactly the line being tested: a refused run must not
reach it, and an allowed one must.
