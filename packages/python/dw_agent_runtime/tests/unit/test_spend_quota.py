"""The per-tenant daily spend guard: mechanism only, gated by a plan's number.

Same shape as test_run_quota.py, and for the same reason: the gate sits in the
runner rather than an API dependency, so a worker reacting to an inbound event
is bound by it too. Every plan ships `spend_usd_per_day=None` today (no dollar
thresholds decided) and `spend_store` defaults to `None` on the runner itself
(any wiring that predates this guard) — both are exercised here as "the gate
is off", not treated as edge cases to skip.
