"""Recorded provider responses, read from disk.

`MockModelAdapter` has been able to load a fixture per prompt since it was
written, `bootstrap/models.py` points it at `evals/fixtures/mock_model`, and
nothing had ever put a file there or read one back. Code that is configured and
never exercised is the shape this repository keeps producing — it reads as a
capability in review and is discovered to be untested by whoever first needs it.

What the fixtures are FOR: running the platform, its evals and its demos without
a provider. A recorded answer is deterministic, costs nothing, and does not go
stale when a model is retired — which is the difference between a suite that can
run on a laptop with no keys and one that cannot.
