"""The per-run spend ceiling, on the path that actually loops.

`RunBudgetLedger` has bounded a run since the profiles grew `budgets` — but only
on `RoutingModelGateway.generate_structured`, the one-shot structured path. The
agent loop talks to its model through `ChatModelFactory`, a bare chat model the
gateway never sees, so the path that CAN loop had no ceiling at all. Its only
bound was `recursion_limit`, which counts steps and not money, and a run that
reached it had already spent whatever those steps cost.

This middleware puts the same ledger in front of every agent model call: refuse
before the call if the run is already over its ceiling, add what the call spent
after it. "Before" is the point — a ceiling checked afterwards is a report on
what was lost, not a limit.

The ledger passed in MUST be the one the gateway and the runner hold. A run that
mixes structured calls and agent steps spends against one ceiling, and the runner
frees the run's entry when it ends; a second ledger would split the spend in two
so neither half ever reaches the limit, and would never be freed.
