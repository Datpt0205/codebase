"""Chat model port for tool-calling agent harnesses.

``ModelGateway`` answers one structured question per call. An agent harness
needs the other shape: a multi-turn model that emits tool calls. Both read the
same ``configs/models`` profiles — an agent picks a profile and gets its
``chat`` route.

LangChain types stay behind this adapter (import-linter enforced).
