"""A sub-agent is the same platform agent, narrowed — never a looser one.

`SubAgentMiddleware` gives the model a `task` tool that runs a second agent with
its own model, tools and prompt. Useful, and the shape of two escapes if the
platform hands it over unattended. Both were MEASURED on the pinned deepagents
rather than reasoned about, because a library's composition is a fact about the
outside world:

**What is already safe.** The sub-agent sees the caller's `RunContext` — same
tenant, same workspace, same scopes, same autonomy level. The context is graph
level, so it carries without being passed, and a `SubAgent` spec has no field
that could replace it. Inheriting *more* than the caller is not reachable from
here.

**What is NOT safe by default, and is the reason this module exists.** The
parent's middleware does not wrap the sub-agent's model call. Measured: with a
probe middleware on both, the order is parent, child, parent — the child's turn
runs inside the child's own stack alone. So the parent's spend ceiling does not
see a single token the sub-agent burns. A worker at a $2 ceiling could spawn a
sub-agent and spend without limit, and the ledger would read as if nothing
happened.

The fix is not a warning in a docstring. `sub_agent_spec` builds the child's
middleware from the parent's spec and hands it **the same ledger object**, so
parent turns and child turns spend against one ceiling. Its tools are built by
`platform_tools` from the parent's executor, so a sub-agent's side effect goes
through the same authorization, idempotency and audit as any other — a context
that passes raw LangChain tools here would be handing the model a way around the
executor, which is why this function takes tool DEFINITIONS and not tools.

`StateBackend`, deliberately: `SubAgentMiddleware` requires a backend, and every
other one reaches a filesystem. The platform installs no file tools (see
`agent_factory`), so a backend that lives in graph state keeps that true.
