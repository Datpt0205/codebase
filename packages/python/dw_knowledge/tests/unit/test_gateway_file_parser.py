"""What the gateway route does with a file the model could not read.

The route is the only one that reads a document by asking a model, so it is the
only one where "I could not open this" arrives as *prose* rather than as an
error. Prose is text, and text is a successful parse - which is how a `.docx`
nobody could open finished as an indexed document, showed on screen as read, and
was quoted back as evidence about the company.

Both halves of the guard are pinned here: the instruction that gives the model a
way to say it, and the reading that recognises it when it does.
