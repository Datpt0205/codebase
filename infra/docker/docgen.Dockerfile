# The sandbox. Code an LLM wrote from text a customer supplied runs in this
# image, so the rule for every line below is: nothing here is worth reaching.
#
# It holds no application package, no database driver, no object-store client
# and no credentials. What it does hold is a document toolchain — the brandkit
# engine, the five OOXML libraries, LibreOffice for PDF, poppler for page
# images, pandoc for reading text back out — and a service with four routes.

# libreoffice-writer-nogui: DOCX -> PDF with no X11 and, deliberately, no JRE.
#   The Java stack is only needed by Base and by some filters; if a conversion
#   turns out to need it the image test fails loudly rather than silently
#   producing a blank page, and the fix is one package.
# poppler-utils: pdftoppm, which turns a PDF page into an image the QA gate can
#   look at.
# pandoc: reads text back out of a generated file, which is how the number check
#   sees what the document actually says.
# fonts-liberation + fonts-dejavu-core: metric-compatible with the Office fonts
#   and both cover Vietnamese diacritics. A .docx does not embed fonts, so these
#   only make the server-rendered PDF match what Word shows.
