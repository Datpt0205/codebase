"""Rebuild a Qdrant collection from the chunks stored in Postgres.

Documents and chunks in Postgres are the source of truth; vectors are derived.
Re-deriving them is what makes changing the embedding model possible at all.

It builds into a TARGET collection and never touches the one currently serving.
The previous version dropped the live collection first and then re-embedded, so
the outage lasted as long as the rebuild - which, against a remote embedding API,
is the whole point at which retrieval is most obviously broken. Build v2, point
readers at it, keep v1 until the new one has been watched for a while.

Run INSIDE the api container, which has the wired gateway and the gateway key:

    docker compose --env-file .env -f infra/compose/docker-compose.yml \
        exec -T -e DW_REINDEX_TARGET=dw_knowledge_v2 api \
        python - < scripts/knowledge_reindex.py

Then set QDRANT_COLLECTION=dw_knowledge_v2 for the api and worker and restart
them. Delete the old collection only after that has run long enough to trust.
