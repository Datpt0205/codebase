"""What the ingest lane does with a job, and what it records when it cannot.

Storing bytes takes milliseconds; parsing and embedding them takes tens of
seconds, and the lane has to survive every way that can go wrong: a file read
only in part, one the parser refuses outright, a recording that takes longer
than a lease. These tests pin what the job row says afterwards in each case,
because that row is what an upload screen shows a person.
