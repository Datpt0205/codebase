"""Knowledge ingest consumer: drains the durable upload queue (B5).

Per tick: claim due jobs → fetch the staged bytes → parse (an API call for
everything but plaintext) → hand the extracted text to the gateway (chunk →
embed → index) → mark done, or requeue with backoff until the budget is spent.

A finished job is also the moment a file on a CRM record stops being bytes and
starts being something that can be quoted. That is the news the lead scorer
waits for, and this is the only place in the system that knows it happened -
which is why the announcement lives at the end of this lane rather than at the
upload, tens of seconds earlier, when nothing could yet be read.
